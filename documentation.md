# Data Types
The project is based on video particle tracking microscopy and analyzing the brownian motion of the bead particles. The data we will obtain will be the position ( X, Y corrdinates)
and lag time (time in sec). These data will be used to analyze the mean square displacement of the bead particle with respect to time. Further we will estimate the visocity of glycerol and comapre it to its standard value
to check the effectiveness of our experiment.Thus based on the data we will obtain after 
running the microrheology experiments on video particle tracking, the data types will be mostly floats and integers. We will be using python tool to analyse the observed data 
estimated from the experiments.
